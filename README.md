Updating local and server files:
-------------------------------

1 - Make sure to always "Pull" before working on a file in order to have latest version

2 - When done working on a file:

    i.   save
    ii.  stage changes (this can be done by either right clicking or pressing + for 'Stage All' in Git tab)
    iii. commit & include message
    iv.  "Push" to update on server (very important! committing is not pushing!)
    
    


Instructions for VS on Mac OS:
-------------------------------

Download GitHub extension for VSCode.

I also suggest downloading the GitHub desktop app if you're not comfortable using the commands in terminal to pull and push changes.

( Although... if you're coding AND debugging on Mac, I wanna talk!? bc I've tried the Xcode method and it only works for me sometimes!??!!! )




Ofc, you can always text me if you're confused!
