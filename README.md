Updating local and server files:


1 - Make sure to always "Pull" before working on a file in order to have latest version

2 - When done working on a file, commit changes and include message (optional I guess)
    and then "Push" to update on server (very important! committing is not pushing!)
    
    
Ofc, you can always text me if you're confused!
